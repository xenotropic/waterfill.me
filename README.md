# waterfill.me
The source code for https://waterfill.me which shows OpenStreetMap drinking fountains. 
Depends on having a tileserver similar to this one: https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-14-04/
See also https://github.com/xenotropic/OSMBright-drinkingwater which is the stylesheet for 
displaying drinking fountains prominently
